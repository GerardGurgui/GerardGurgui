👋 I’m Gerard Gurgui

Responsible, proactive, and self-taught, constantly learning and practicing.

I’m a higher education student in Web Application Development, a field that has sparked a strong passion in me and motivates me to keep learning and improving every day.

I chose to complete the Backend Bootcamp with Java and Spring at IT Academy. It was a major challenge and an even greater satisfaction to complete it, gaining solid knowledge and skills in Java and in the development of RESTful web services and REST APIs.

Thanks to this, I am currently collaborating on an Open Source project for the Government of Catalonia.

👀 Interested in:

The tech world—especially development and programming. Motivated and passionate about creating RESTful web services, REST APIs, applications, and backend services.

🌱 Continuous learning:

After finishing the bootcamp, I’ve had the great opportunity to collaborate on work-oriented projects with a team of developers. And of course, I continue learning and practicing on my own: documentation, best practices, resources, and guides.

📫 Technical skills:

Development of RESTful web services and REST APIs with Java, Spring (Spring Boot), JPA, Hibernate, relational and non-relational databases (SQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB)

I have worked on projects involving microservices architectures, reactive applications with Spring WebFlux, and secure authentication/authorization using Spring Security, JWT, and OAuth.
Testing with JUnit 5 and Mockito

Thymeleaf, HTML, basic CSS

💞️ My goals:

My goal is to keep growing in the tech field, contribute with my knowledge, and continue collaborating and learning in the professional environment.
